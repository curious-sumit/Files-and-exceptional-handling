        "    - Exception handling in Python follows a clear and structured process that helps keep program safe and stable when unexpected events occur. Here's a step-by-step breakdown to make it crystal clear:\n",
        "      * Identify Risky Code with try - Wrap the code that might raise an exception inside a try block.\n",
        "      * Catch Specific Exceptions with except - Use one or more except blocks to handle anticipated errors.\n",
        "      * Use else for Successful Execution (Optional) - The else block runs only if the try block succeeds without raising exceptions.\n",
        "      * Use finally to Clean Up (Always Executes) - Put any cleanup code—like closing files or releasing connections—here.\n",

        "    - Following reasons of Memory management important in Python:\n",
        "      1 Prevents Memory Leaks -\n",
        "        * If unused objects aren't freed, they consume memory over time.\n",
        "        * In long-running programs—like servers or data pipelines—this could lead to crashes or serious performance drops.\n",

        "      2 Boosts Performance -\n",
        "        * Efficient memory usage helps Python respond faster.\n",
        "        * Especially critical when working with large datasets, multimedia processing, or real-time computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "      3 Keeps Resources Clean -\n",
        "        * Good memory management ensures that files, network connections, and other external resources are closed or cleaned up when no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "      4 Enables Scalability -\n",
        "        * If building apps that handle lots of users or data streams (like IoT systems or cloud services), managing memory wisely ensures they grow without breaking.\n",

        "      5 Enhances Security & Stability -\n",

        "\n",
        "       1. Reference Counting: Python's Primary Mechanism -\n",
        "         * Every object in memory has a reference count: the number of active references pointing to it.\n",
        "         * When the count drops to zero (i.e., nothing is using it), the memory is immediately deallocated.\n",

        "         * Even if no variable refers to obj1 or obj2, their internal references keep them \"alive.\"\n",
        "         * Python's gc module comes in here to detect and clean these up\n",

        "    - The following challenges associated with memory management in Python:\n",
        "      1. Memory Leaks:\n",
        "         * Occur when objects are no longer needed but still referenced somewhere in the program.\n",
        "         * Common in circular references or when global variables or caches are not cleared.\n",
        "         \n",
        "      2. Circular References:\n",
        "         * Python's reference counting can't clean up objects that reference each other.\n",
        "         * The garbage collector handles these, but it doesn't run constantly—so cleanup may be delayed.\n",
        "      \n",
        "      3. Memory Fragmentation:\n",
        "         * Happens when memory is allocated and freed in uneven chunks.\n",
        "         * Over time, this can leave small unusable gaps in memory, reducing efficiency.\n",
        "         * Especially problematic in real-time or embedded systems\n",
        "\n",
        "      4. Performance Overhead from Garbage Collection:\n",
        "         * Python's garbage collector can pause program to clean up memory.\n",
        "         * These pauses may be negligible in small scripts but noticeable in real-time or high-throughput systems\n",
        "\n",
        "      5. Unintended Object Retention:\n",
        "         * Holding onto large data structures longer than necessary (e.g., in global scope or closures).\n",
        "         * Forgetting to release file handles, sockets, or database connections.\n",
        "         * It can lead to bloated memory usage and sluggish performance\n",
        "\n",
        "      6. Lack of Fine-Grained Control:\n",
        "         * Unlike C/C++, Python doesn't manually allocate or free memory.\n",
        "         * This abstraction is great for safety but limits optimization in memory-constrained environments\n",
        "\n",
        "      7. Debugging Memory Issues:\n",
        "         * Tools like gc, tracemalloc, and memory_profiler exist—but they require extra effort to use effectively.\n",
